    - Added a recipe to destroy dilute sulfuric acid.
    - Reduced how much dilute sulfuric acid you get from force reduction recipes compared to total fluid in (30 --> 50)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.12
Date: 28. 01. 2025
  Bugfixes:
    - Added data-final-fixes. In this file we do one line: data.raw["lab"]["pressure-lab"].inputs = data.raw['lab']['lab'].inputs . Any mod that handled adding their stuff to sciences to the base lab will be in my lab, regardless of how my they added their science to lab. Yes, it took me a while to come up with this obvious solution. My brain is potato. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.11
Date: 27. 01. 2025
  Bugfixes:
    - Fixed cache system, no need to update every 720 milliseconds. Programming was right, I just accidentally overrode the event. Fun fact, you can only respond to each event once, even with different filters. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.10
Date: 25. 01. 2025
  Major Features:
    - asphalt-and-concrete research no longer takes production or utility science. This fixes a lubricant bottle neck.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.9
Date: 25. 01. 2025
  Major Features:
    - Gleba plastics productivity now buffs sulfonated plastic recipes. Go ham
    - Added hot water to steam recipe. This should be a good end to the dilute sulfuric acid crafting chain. And a use for tons of the free solid fuel.
    - dilute acid neutralization --> 2 calcite.
    - updated localization files.
    - Something else I added yesterday but forgot. 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.8
Date: 24. 01. 2025
  Major Features:
    - New controlled combustion recipe to convert petroleum gas to CO2. (Can't get red boiler to be any better, but this should help with CO2 production)
    - Reduced time it takes for sulfuric acid dilution
    - Steam as a product of concentration/pressurization recipes now correctly at 500C    
    - New recipe Dilute acid neutralization. Turn dilute sulfuric acid directly into water. This should make it easy to get rid of dilute sulfuric acid
    - Fixed auto place control names in localization
    - Moved red engine/boiler recipes to Corundum planet discovery.
    - TODO consider how to reorganize all the chemistry recipes.
    - TODO consider a recipe to cool 100 degree water. 
    - Updated force reduction recipes. Now 1 plate, 200 fluid --> 3 ore.
    - Alternative dilution recipe
    - Updated localization files.
    - TODO review markdown syntax and move this to change log.
    - Updated reactive-displacement recipe. 1 iron plate can convert 200 mixed sulfate solution to 200 Iron sulfate solution, 2 copper ore. This should allow you to produce iron instead of being iron neutral.
    - Condensed several technologies to optimize gameplay flow. All recipes
    - Corrundum planet discovery now available when main planets are available.
    - Added a planet connection from nauvis to corrundum. Rip to nice star map.
    - Petroleum tile can now be covered by landfill.
    - Nerfed space steam production recipe by a factor of about 20,
    - Adjusted platinum thruster efficiency. It is now efficient only at high fuel consumption. Hence, you want to be cognizant of this thruster when you run low on fuel. The goal is not replace normal thrusters, but increase the depth of ship design and allow for faster speeds. Note that this is the inverse of the base thruster, who gets more efficient at low fuel values.
    - Added achievements related to visiting the Corrundum and using electrochemical science.
    - auto_recycle on concrete recipe introduced by this mod is now false. This should ensure that this mod does not alter fulgora recycling.
    - Added alternative recrystalization recipes - convert excess gears and cables to their respective sulfate solutions.
    - New calcium sulfate recipe. With time consuming effort and techinques from organic chemistry, we can recover calcium sulfate from nutrients. Now we can use calcium sulfate to make lots of stone of gleba. Making use of this recipe is a challenge, and serves as an alternative to importing calcite.
    - Added fish to icebox functionality and tested it. (Yes fish in the icebox caused a crash because I manually put in stack sizes, and I put in the wrong stack size.)
    - Fixed the wrong cache being updated upon building/destroying an ice box. Sorry if this caused problems.
    - Added robust nil checking to the code. If we are using tick function on an entity, and we get a nil value, we remake the crash and continue with a different part of the loop.
    - Posted on github.
