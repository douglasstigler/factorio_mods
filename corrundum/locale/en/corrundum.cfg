corrundum=Corrundum

[space-location-description]
corrundum=A planet blanketed in CO2 gas with enough oxygen for combustion. Consequently, pressures and temperatures are high here. Runaway greenhouse effect has ensured conditions are harsher than Vulcanus, with no signs of life anywhere between the dirt and the lightning storms. High pressures ensure normally volatile petroleum gas is a liquid here - and there is a ton of it. Iron and copper are mostly locked up together as chalcopyrite. The metal of interest here is platinum, which is used as a catalyst in advanced sulfur processing and as an anode and cathode for electrochemistry. An entirely unique crafting chain centered around sulfur is necessary to master this planet.

red-steam-engine=A modified steam engine. Uses the thermoelectric effect to produce energy. It is designed to take in hot CO2 gas, and produce power - at a significant pollution cost.

dilute-acid-neutralization=We get enough heat energy from neutralization to boil water.
hot-water-to-steam=Just a bit more energy to turn hot water into 500 degree steam.
petroleum-alkylation=Large amounts of sulfuric acid can form carbocations, which are used as the basis for alkylation to form new carbon-carbon bonds.
light-oil-alkylation=Large amounts of sulfuric acid can form carbocations, which are used as the basis for alkylation to form new carbon-carbon bonds. We use this form to get heavy oil.

sulfur-reduction=Sulfur is reduced to a zero oxidation state, while water is formed.

hydrogen-sulfide-combustion=Combustion of hydrogen sulfide gives us more components to make sulfuric acid.
chalcopyrite-refining=Chalcopyrite is FeCuS. We blast the ore with heat and concentrated sulfuric acid to fully oxidize the metals, forming a mixture of their aqueous sulfate salts.
reactive-displacement=Iron is more reactive than copper. Thus we can use it to displace copper ions in the solution.
force-reduction-iron=We can use voltage to pump electronics into the ionic solution. These electrons reduce aqueous ferric ions into pure iron. The pure product must be shaped back into plates.
force-reduction-copper=Similar to reduction of ferric sulfate, we pump electrons in and they reduce copper ions.
sulfonated-plastic=With a platinum catalyst, we use sulfur dioxide and oxygen to form sulfur trioxide. Sulfur trioxide reacts with sulfuric acid to form fuming sulfuric acid, which can sulfonate hydrocarbons.
sulfonated-plastic-production-alt=With a platinum catalyst, we use sulfur dioxide and oxygen to form sulfur trioxide. Sulfur trioxide reacts with sulfuric acid to form fuming sulfuric acid, which can sulfonate hydrocarbons.

sulfuric-acid-dilution=Add acid to water to dilute safely, not the other way around.
sulfuric-acid-concentration=We spend a lot of energy boiling off water into steam, which can be condensed back into water.
sulfuric-acid-concentration-alt=We spend a lot of energy boiling off water, and do not bother to condense it.
calcium-sulfate-production-alt=Sulfur dioxide and calcium carbonate react to form calcium sulfate and carbon dioxide.
stone-production=Stone is represented by SiO2 (reactant) and CaSiO3 (product). Analogous to making stone on Vulcanus.
asphalt-c=We condense heavy oil into a concrete precursor.
asphalt-c-alt=We can also use excess light oil to make asphalt. Reaction is faster, but less efficient.
concrete-production-from-asphalt=Asphalt and stone makes concrete.

super-saturated-displacement-iron=Super saturated displacement with iron.
sulfur-poison-capsule=Upgraded chemical warfare.
blue-rocket=More explosive rocket, stuffed with a powerful new explosive.
sulfuric-oxidizer=Sulfonate a hydrocarbon product so it has lots of oxygen groups - allowing it to react as an oxidizing agent for explosive reactions.
explosives-from-sulfuric-oxidizer=Package sulfuric oxidizer into a bundles of explosive.
petrol-dehydrogenation-and-combustion=With a platinum catalyst, we can use it to dehydrogenate hydrocarbons to get alkynes, and alkenes and hydrogen gas. This is an endothermic process that requires high pressures, so it takes time. After dehydrogenation, we completely combust the unsaturated products to get carbon dioxide.
petrol-dehydrogenation-and-combustion-maraxsis=We supply the O2!
kinetic-reactive-displacement=More iron to react faster to displace copper.
